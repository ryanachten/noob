# noob - SOLID

Examples of issues caused by not adhering to SOLID principles, as well as the steps taken to address these violations.

- [**S**ingle Responsibility Principle](./SingleResponsibility/) -  A class should only have one job and therefore only one reason to change
- [**O**pen Closed Principle](./OpenClosed/) - Objects should be open for extension but closed to modifications
- [**L**iskov Substitution Principle](./LiskovSubstitution/) - Parent classes should be substitutable by their derived classes
- [**I**nterface Segregation Principle](./InterfaceSegregation/) -  A client should never be forced to implement an interface or methods it doesn't use
- [**D**ependency Inversion Principle](./DependencyInversion/) - Entities should depend on abstractions instead of concretions
