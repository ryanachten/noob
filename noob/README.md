Data structure and algorithms.

## Data Structures

While many of these already out of the box with .NET, these have been implemented from the ground up to better understand the internals of these data structures. Only features required by exercises have been implemented.

A decision tree for helping guide data structure selection has been created [here\*](./DataStructureDecisionTree.md).

- [x] LinkedLists
- [x] ArrayLists
- [x] StringBuilders
- [x] Hash Tables
- [x] Stacks
- [x] Queues
- [x] Trees
  - [x] Binary Tree
    - [x] Binary Search Tree
  - [x] Priority Queues
    - [x] MinHeaps
    - [x] MaxHeaps
  - [x] Tries
- [x] Graphs
  - [x] Adjacency List
  - [x] Adjacency Matrix
  - [x] Directed Graph

## Algorithms

A decision tree for helping guide algorithm selection has been created [here\*](./AlgorithmDecisionTree.md).

- **Sorting**
  - [x] Selection Sort
  - [x] Bubble Sort
  - [x] Merge Sort
  - [x] Quick Sort
  - [x] Radix Sort
- **Search**
  - [x] Binary Search
  - [x] Depth-First Search
  - [x] Breadth-First Search
- **Strings**
  - [x] Permutations
- **Path Finding**

  - [x] Dijkstra Shortest Path

## Misc

- Space and times for common algorithms and data structures created [here](./SpaceAndTimes.md).
- \*_Disclaimer:_ these decision trees are not comprehensive - there are obviously many factors to consider when selecting an algorithm. These trees simply highlight decisions I found helpful when approaching exercises.
